Researchers have proposed numerous micro-robotic swimming methods, with the vast majority utilizing magnetic fields to wirelessly power and control the microrobot. In this paper, we compare three promising methods of microrobot swimming (using magnetic fields to rotate helical propellers that mimic bacterial flagella, using magnetic fields to oscillate a magnetic head with a rigidly attached elastic tail, and pulling directly with magnetic field gradients) considering practical hardware limitations in the generation of magnetic fields. We find that helical propellers and elastic tails have very comparable performance, and they generally become more desirable than gradient pulling as size decreases and as distance from the magnetic-field-generation source increases. We provide a discussion of why helical propellers are likely the best overall choice for in vivo applications.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract--- A hybrid walking neuroprosthesis that combines functional electrical stimulation (FES) with a powered lower limb exoskeleton provides therapeutic benefits of FES and torque reliability of the powered exoskeleton. Moreover, by harnessing metabolic power of muscles via FES the hybrid combination has a potential of lowering power consumption and reducing actuator size for the powered exoskeleton. Its control design, however, must overcome the challenges of actuator redundancy due to the combined use of FES and electric motor. Further, to maintain stability and control performance when disparate dynamics of FES and electric motor are combined, dynamical disturbances such as electromechanical delay (EMD) and muscle fatigue must be considered during the control design process. In this paper, a general framework to coordinate FES of multiple gait-governing muscles with electric motors is presented. A human motor control-inspired synergy-based control framework is used to derive the controller and is motivated mainly to address the actuator redundancy issue. Dynamic postural synergies between FES of the muscles and the electric motors were artificially generated through optimizations and result in key dynamic postures when activated. These synergies were used in the feedforward path of the control system. A dynamic surface control technique, modified with a delay compensation term, is used as the feedback controller to address model uncertainty, the cascaded muscle activation dynamics, and EMD. To address muscle fatigue, the stimulation levels in the feedforward path were gradually increased based on a model-based fatigue estimate. A Lyapunov-based stability approach was used to derive the controllers and guarantee their stability. The synergy-based controller was demonstrated experimentally on an able-bodied subject and person with an incomplete SCI.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper reports the use of a MRI device to pull a magnetic microrobot inside a vessel and control its trajectory. The bead subjected to magnetic and hydrodynamic forces is first modeled as a nonlinear control system. Then, a backstepping approach is discussed in order to synthesize a feedback law ensuring the stability along the controlled trajectory. We show that this control law, combined with a high gain observer, provides good tracking performances and robustness to measurement noise as well as to some matched uncertainties.},

  Abstract                 = {Computer models that estimate the force generation capacity of lower limb muscles have become widely used to simulate the effects of musculoskeletal surgeries and create dynamic simulations of movement. Previous lower limb models are based on severely limited data describing limb muscle architecture (i.e., muscle fiber lengths, pennation angles, and physiological cross-sectional areas). Here, we describe a new model of the lower limb based on data that quantifies the muscle architecture of 21 cadavers. The model includes geometric representations of the bones, kinematic descriptions of the joints, and Hill-type models of 44 muscle--tendon compartments. The model allows calculation of muscle--tendon lengths and moment arms over a wide range of body positions. The model also allows detailed examination of the force and moment generation capacities of muscles about the ankle, knee, and hip and is freely available at www.simtk.org .},

  Abstract                 = {The force of a single muscle is not directly measurable without invasive methods. Yet invasive techniques are not appropriate for clinical use, thus a non-invasive technique that combined the electromyographic (EMG) signal and a neuromuscular model was developed to determine in vivo active muscle forces at the hip. The EMG-to-force processing (EFP) model included active and passive moment components, and the net EFP moment was compared with the hip moment obtained with standard inverse dynamics techniques ({\{}''{\}}gold standard{\{}''{\}}). The two methods were compared at percent gait cycle intervals, and the correlation coefficient between methods was excellent (r(2) = 91). The closeness of fit confirms that the approach is a reasonable approximation of net moment and, possibly, individual muscle forces. The greatest estimated hip force was produced by a hip abductor. A novel finding was that the hip adductors did not behave a single synergistic group. The Adductor Magnus synergistically assisted other hip extensors, and produced forces that were out-of-phase with the other hip adductor forces. Rectus Femoris was only active during hip flexion (not knee extension).},

The main motivation comes from the theory of Kalman filters for continuous-time nonlinear systems with sampled measurements, where this type of equation often arises. Stability is to be understood in the following sense: under appropriate hypotheses, the solution matrix is always symmetric positive definite and bounded from above and below. No uniformity is expected from the sampling procedure, only an upper bound on the elapsed time between consecutive samples is needed. The exposition consists of two parts. First, the stability properties are proven and second, by means of three examples, it is shown how the article's main result applies.},

  Abstract                 = {Background: Ultrasound imaging is a valuable tool which, when applied appropriately, has the potential to provide information regarding the mechanics of abdominal muscle contraction. Typically, changes in muscle thickness are obtained and interpreted. However, the link between ultrasound measures of muscle thickening and EMG measures of activation is not clear. Methods: Five healthy males performed a series of abdominal muscle contractions while surface EMG and trunk posture were monitored and ultrasound images of the internal oblique and external oblique were captured both at relaxation and upon contraction. Ramped isometric flexor and extensor moment contractions were also assessed and compared between EMG and ultrasound. Findings: No definitive relationship between increases in muscle activation and corresponding measures of thickening was observed. Correlations between the two measures, across all contraction types, were 0.14 for internal oblique and -0.22 for external oblique. Interpretation: The lack of clear association between abdominal muscle activation and thickening may be due to the composite laminate-like structure of the abdominal wall, with force being transmitted between obliquely oriented muscle layers. Thus, ultrasound alone may not be a valid measure of muscle activation or force in the unique architecture of the abdominal wall. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  Abstract                 = {We prove a necessary and sufficient condition for the solution of the time-invariant Riccati differential equation to converge towards the strong solution of the corresponding algebraic Riccati equation, when the system is stabilizable, without assuming that the Hamiltonian matrix has no eigenvalues on the imaginary axis (or equivalently that there are no critical unobservable modes). The condition is a generalization of an earlier one established by Callier and Willems. Our proof revises an earlier one by Faurre, Clerget, and Germain, leading to additional information of what can be assumed without loss of generality in our context. It is also shown that the convergence is not always exponential and that the presence of critical unobservable modes may slow down but does not prevent the convergence of the solution of the Riccati differential equation. The impact of the condition on linear-quadratic optimal control is briefly discussed. {\textcopyright} 1995 Academic Press, Inc.},

Two-dimensional rearfoot motion was recorded from 23 feet. The feet were assigned to one of two experimental groups. Muscle activity was recorded from the tibialis anterior muscle using surface electrodes. The early pronators (N = 12) reached maximal pronation within the first 20K of the stance phase. The late pronators (N = 11) reached maximal pronation only after 40{\%} of the stance phase. The results of a C-test showed that there was a significant difference (P {\textless} .05) in the time to minimal tibialis anterior muscle activity between the two groups. These results indicate that tibialis anterior muscle activity can influence rearfoot motion during the stance phase of walking. A clinician should consider the muscular system when evaluating and designing a treatment program for patients with foot-related problems. The results of this study also indicate that static nonwei...},

  Abstract                 = {During human locomotion lower extremity muscle-tendon units undergo cyclic length changes that were previously assumed to be representative of muscle fascicle length changes. Measurements in cats and humans have since revealed that muscle fascicle length changes can be uncoupled from those of the muscle-tendon unit. Ultrasonography is frequently used to estimate fascicle length changes during human locomotion. Fascicle length analysis requires time consuming manual methods that are prone to human error and experimenter bias. To bypass these limitations, we have developed an automatic fascicle tracking method based on the Lucas-Kanade optical flow algorithm with an affine optic flow extension. The aims of this study were to compare gastrocnemius fascicle length changes during locomotion using the automated and manual approaches and to determine the repeatability of the automated approach. Ultrasound was used to examine gastrocnemius fascicle lengths in eight participants walking at 4, 5, 6, and 7 km/h and ...},

  Abstract                 = {The goal of this chapter is to provide tools for analyzing and controlling nonholonomic mechanical systems. This classical subject has received renewed attention because nonholonomic constraints arise in many advanced robotic structures, such as mobile robots, space manipulators, and multifingered robot hands. Nonholonomic behavior in robotic systems is particularly interesting, because it implies that the mechanism can be completely controlled with a reduced number of actuators. On the other hand, both planning and control are much more difficult than in conventional holonomic sys- tems, and require special techniques. We show first that the nonholonomy of kinematic constraints in mechanical systems is equivalent to the controllability of an associated control system, so that integrability conditions may be sought by exploiting concepts from nonlinear control theory. Basic tools for the analysis and stabilization of nonlinear control systems are reviewed and used to obtain conditions for partial or complete non- holonomy, so as to devise a classification of nonholonomic systems. Several kinematic models of nonholonomic systems are presented, including examples of wheeled mobile robots, free-floating space structures and redundant manipulators. We introduce then the dynamics of nonholonomic systems and a procedure for partial linearization of the corresponding control system via feedback. These points are illustrated by deriving the dynamical models of two previously considered systems. Finally, we discuss some general issues of the control problem for nonholonomic systems and present open-loop and feedback control techniques, illustrated also by numerical simulations.},

  Abstract                 = {The goal of this chapter is to provide tools for analyzing and controlling nonholonomic mechanical systems. This classical subject has received renewed attention because nonholonomic constraints arise in many advanced robotic structures, such as mobile robots, space manipulators, and multifingered robot hands. Nonholonomic behavior in robotic systems is particularly interesting, because it implies that the mechanism can be completely controlled with a reduced number of actuators. On the other hand, both planning and control are much more difficult than in conventional holonomic sys- tems, and require special techniques. We show first that the nonholonomy of kinematic constraints in mechanical systems is equivalent to the controllability of an associated control system, so that integrability conditions may be sought by exploiting concepts from nonlinear control theory. Basic tools for the analysis and stabilization of nonlinear control systems are reviewed and used to obtain conditions for partial or complete non- holonomy, so as to devise a classification of nonholonomic systems. Several kinematic models of nonholonomic systems are presented, including examples of wheeled mobile robots, free-floating space structures and redundant manipulators. We introduce then the dynamics of nonholonomic systems and a procedure for partial linearization of the corresponding control system via feedback. These points are illustrated by deriving the dynamical models of two previously considered systems. Finally, we discuss some general issues of the control problem for nonholonomic systems and present open-loop and feedback control techniques, illustrated also by numerical simulations.},

  Abstract                 = {Adoption of wearable assistive technologies relies heavily on improvement of existing control system models. Knowing which models to use and how to improve them is difficult to determine due to the number of proposed solutions with relatively little broad comparisons. One type of these models, muscle activation models, describes the nonlinear relationship between neural inputs and mechanical activation of the muscle. Many muscle activation models can be found in the literature, but no comparison is available to guide the community on limitations and improvements. In this research, an EMG-driven elbow motion model is developed for the purpose of evaluating muscle activation models. Seven muscle activation models are used in an optimization procedure to determine which model has the best performance. Root mean square errors in muscle torque estimation range from 1.67â2.19 Nm on average over varying input trajectories. The computational resource demand was also measured during the optimization procedure, as it is an important aspect for determining if a model is feasible for use in a particular wearable assistive device. This study provides insight into the ability of these models to estimate elbow motion and the trade-off between estimation accuracy and computational demand.},

  Abstract                 = {We previously reported the development of a force- and fatigue-model system that predicted accurately forces during repetitive fatiguing activation of human skeletal muscles using brief duration (six-pulse) stimulation trains. The model system was tested in the present study using force responses produced by longer duration stimulation trains, containing up to 50 pulses. Our results showed that our model successfully predicted the peak forces produced when the muscle was repetitively activated with stimulation trains of frequencies ranging from 20 to 40 Hz, train durations ranging from 0.5 to 1 s, and varied pulse patterns. The predicted peak forces throughout each protocol matched the experimental peak forces with r2 values above 0.9 and predicted successfully the forces at the end of each protocol with {\textless}15{\%} error for all protocols tested. The success of our model system further supports its potential use for the design of optimal stimulation patterns for individual users during functional electrical stimulation.},

These two components are fabricated monolithically from the same sheet of conductive polysilicon, and receive a common power and control signal through a capacitive coupling with an underlying electrical grid. All locations on the grid receive the same power and control signal, so that the devices can be operated without knowledge of their position on the substrate. Individual control of the component actuators provides two distinct motion gaits (forward motion and turning), which together allow full coverage of a planar workspace. These MEMS micro-robots demonstrate turning error of less than 3.7{\&}deg;/mm during forward motion, turn with radii as small as 176 {\&}mu;m, and achieve speeds of over 200 {\&}mu;m/sec with an average step size as small as 12 nm.

The device includes a DC motor, a worm gear and a customized torsion spring. Since the elastic element is the most important component in the actuator design, a finite element analysis is used to meet the specific requirements of knee assistance. The proposed impedance control scheme comprises three cascade controllers: an inner-loop PI velocity controller, a PI torque controller, and an outer-loop PD position controller. The impedance controller's performance is evaluated through the Frequency Response Function analysis, and experimental results demonstrate the ability of the system to reproduce impedance behavior within an amplitude and frequency range compatible for gait assistance.},

Long-term use of a foot-drop stimulator applying functional electrical stimulation (FES) to the common peroneal nerve improves walking performance even when the stimulator is off. This âtherapeuticâ? effect might result from neuroplastic changes. Objective. To determine the effect of long-term use of a foot-drop stimulator on residual corticospinal connections in people with central nervous system disorders. Methods. Ten people with nonprogressive disorders (eg, stroke) and 26 with progressive disorders (eg, multiple sclerosis) used a foot-drop stimulator for 3 to 12 months while walking in the community. Walking performance and electrophysiological variables were measured before and after FES use. From the surface electromyogram of the tibialis anterior muscle, we measured the following: (1) motor-evoked potential (MEP) from transcranial magnetic stimulation over the motor cortex, (2) maximum voluntary contraction (MVC), and (3) maximum motor wave (Mmax) from stimulating the common peroneal ne...},

Physiol. 82(1): 354â358, 1997.âWe have developed a technique to determine fascicle length in human vastus lateralis muscle in vivo by using ultrasonography. When the subjects had the knee fully extended passively from a position of 110Â° flexion (relaxed condition), the fascicle length decreased from 133 to 97 mm on average. During static contractions at 10{\%} of maximal voluntary contraction strength (tensed condition), fascicle shortening was more pronounced (from 126 to 67 mm), especially when the knee was closer to full extension. Similarly, as the knee was extended, the angle of pennation (fascicle angle, defined as the angle between fascicles and aponeurosis) increased (relaxed, from 14 to 18Â°; tensed, from 14 to 21Â°), and a greater increase in the pennation angle was observed in the tensed than in the relaxed condition wh...},

  Abstract                 = {The in vivo assessment of the biomechanical properties of the skeletal muscle is a complex issue because the muscle is an anisotropic, viscoelastic and dynamic medium. In this article, these mechanical properties are characterized for the brachialis muscle in vivo using a noninvasive ultrasound-based technique. This supersonic shear imaging technique combines an ultra-fast ultrasonic system and the remote generation of transient mechanical forces into tissue via the radiation force of focused ultrasonic beams. Such an ultrasonic radiation force is induced deep within the muscle by a conventional ultrasonic probe and the resulting shear waves are then imaged with the same probe (5 MHz) at an ultra-fast framerate (up to 5000 frames/s). Local tissue velocity maps are obtained with a conventional speckle tracking technique and provide a full movie of the shear wave propagation through the entire muscle. Shear wave group velocities are then estimated using a time of flight algorithm. This approach provides a complete set of quantitative and in vivo parameters describing the muscle's mechanical properties as a function of active voluntary contraction as well as passive extension of healthy volunteers. Anisotropic properties are also estimated by tilting the probe head with respects to the main muscular fibers direction. Finally, the dispersion of the shear waves is studied for these different configurations and shear modulus and shear viscosity are quantitatively assessed assuming the viscoelastic Voigt's model. {\textcopyright} 2010 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine {\&} Biology.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper reviews the literature relating to the biofeedback used in physical rehabilitation. The biofeedback methods used in rehabilitation are based on biomechanical measurements and measurements of the physiological systems of the body. The physiological systems of the body which can be measured to provide biofeedback are the neuromuscular system, the respiratory system and the cardiovascular system. Neuromuscular biofeedback methods include electromyography (EMG) biofeedback and real-time ultrasound imaging (RTUS) biofeedback. EMG biofeedback is the most widely investigated method of biofeedback and appears to be effective in the treatment of many musculoskeletal conditions and in post cardiovascular accident (CVA) rehabilitation. RTUS biofeedback has been demonstrated effective in the treatment of low back pain (LBP) and pelvic floor muscle dysfunction. Cardiovascular biofeedback methods have been shown to be effective in the treatment of a number of health conditions such as hypertension, heart failure, asthma, fibromyalgia and even psychological disorders however a systematic review in this field has yet to be conducted. Similarly, the number of large scale studies examining the use of respiratory biofeedback in rehabilitation is limited. Measurements of movement, postural control and force output can be made using a number of different devices and used to deliver biomechanical biofeedback. Inertial based sensing biofeedback is the most widely researched biomechanical biofeedback method, with a number of studies showing it to be effective in improving measures of balance in a number of populations. Other types of biomechanical biofeedback include force plate systems, electrogoniometry, pressure biofeedback and camera based systems however the evidence for these is limited. Biofeedback is generally delivered using visual displays, acoustic or haptic signals, however more recently virtual reality (VR) or exergaming technology have been used as biofeedback signals. VR and exergaming technology have been primarily investigated in post-CVA rehabilitation, however, more recent work has shown this type of biofeedback to be effective in improving exercise technique in musculoskeletal populations. While a number of studies in this area have been conducted, further large scale studies and reviews investigating different biofeedback applications in different clinical populations are required.},

  Abstract                 = {This work studies the dynamic relationship between the electrical activity produced in skeletal muscles and recorded using electromyogram(EMG), and torque at the healthy human ankle during isometric contractions. Subjects were instructed to voluntarily modulate their ankle torque by tracking a pseudo-random visual command signal. Impulse response functions (IRF) estimated between the EMG and torque records had an unphysiological anticipatory component suggesting that the estimated IRF was biased because the data were recorded in closed-loop. Applying a closed-loop identification algorithm that modeled the EMG-torque relation as a nonparametric impulse response function, and the noise as an autoregressive-moving-average process gave unbiased results. The EMG-torque IRF had second-order, low-pass, dynamics, whose properties varied with the mean torque.},

In the present study, we further compared subjects' performance using SMG and surface electromyography (EMG) in a series of discrete tracking tasks, both with and without a concurrent auditory attention task. Sixteen healthy subjects used different signals in a random order to control the cursor on a personal computer screen to cancel the letter âEâ? in a sequence of vertically arranged letters. Subjects' performance was evaluated under isometric contraction and wrist extension using the extensor carpi radiali muscle. The percentage of successfully cancelled Es using SMG decreased by 21 Â± 16{\%} and 17 Â± 11{\%} in isometric contraction and wrist extension tests, respectively, compared with the corresponding performances using force and angle signals. The corresponding reduction recorded by using EMG was 40 Â± 29{\%} and 41 Â± 25{\%}. In addition, there was a significant decrease by using EMG compared with that by SMG (p {\textless} 0.001). The results also demonstrated that there was no significant difference of performances of canceling E between the single and dual tasks by using any of the control signals (p {\textgreater} 0.99). Furthermore, the SMG control provided more consistent performances under the single and dual tasks compared with EMG control.},

The muscle architectural parameters extracted from ultrasound imaging, which reflect muscle contractions, were defined as sonomyography (SMG) in this study. The cross-sectional area (CSA) and aspect ratio between muscle width and thickness (width/thickness) were extracted from ultrasound images. The results showed that the CSA of RF muscles decreased by 7.25Â±4.07{\%} when muscle torque output changed from 0{\%} to 90{\%} MVC, and the aspect ratio decreased by 41.66Â±7.96{\%}. The muscle contraction level and SMG data were strongly correlated (R2=0.961, P=0.003, for CSA and R2=0.999, P{\textless}0.001, for width/thickness ratio). The data indicated a significant difference (P{\textless}0.05) in percentage changes for CSA and aspect ratio among step, ramp increasing, and decreasing contractions. The normalized EMG RMS in ramp increasing was 8.25Â±4.00{\%} higher than step (P=0.002). The normalized MMG RMS of step contraction was significantly lower than ramp increasing and decreasing, with averaged differences of 12.22Â±3.37{\%} (P=0.001) and 12.06Â±3.37{\%} (P=0.001), respectively. The results of this study demonstrated that the CSA and aspect ratio, i.e., SMG signals, can provide useful information about muscle contractions. They may therefore complement EMG and MMG for studying muscle activation strategies under different conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {The surface myoelectric signal (MES) has been used as an input to controllers for powered prostheses for many years. As a result of recent technological advances it is reasonable to assume that there will soon be implantable myoelectric sensors which will enable the internal MES to be used as input to these controllers. An internal MES measurement should have less muscular crosstalk allowing for more independent control sites. However, it remains unclear if this benefit outweighs the loss of the more global information contained in the surface MES. This paper compares the classification accuracy of six pattern recognition-based myoelectric controllers which use multi-channel surface MES as inputs to the same controllers which use multi-channel intramuscular MES as inputs. An experiment was designed during which surface and intramuscular MES were collected simultaneously for 10 different classes of isometric contraction. There was no significant difference in classification accuracy as a result of using the intramuscular MES measurement technique when compared to the surface MES measurement technique. Impressive classification accuracy (97{\%}) could be achieved by optimally selecting only three channels of surface MES.},

  Abstract                 = {Gait dysfunction due to lower limb central paralysis, frequently involving drop foot, is a common cause of disability in multiple sclerosis and has been treated with transcutaneous functional electrical stimulation (FES). We provide here the first report of 4-channel semi-implantable FES of the peroneal nerve which has been successfully used for rehabilitation in patients following stroke. FES was implemented via a 4-channel semi-implantable closed-loop system (ActiGait{\textregistered}, {\textcopyright}Ottobock), generating dorsiflexion in drop foot. Walking distance, gait symmetry (temporospatial gait analyses, Vicon Motion Systems{\textregistered}), gait velocity (10Â m walking test) and quality of life (SF-36 questionnaire) were measured to evaluate the therapeutic benefit of this system in two patients with progressive MS. Walking distance increased from 517 to 1884Â m in Patient 1 and from 52 to 506Â m in Patient 2. Gait velocity did not change significantly in Patient 1 and increased from 0.6 to 0.8Â m/s in Patient 2. Maximum deviations of center of mass from the midline to each side changed significantly after 3Â months of stimulation compared to baseline, decreasing from 15 to 12Â mm in Patient 1 and from 47 to 37Â mm in Patient 2. Both patients experienced reduced pain and fatigue and benefits to quality of life. Adverse events did not occur during the observation period. We conclude that implantable 4-channel FES systems are not only feasible but present a promising new alternative for treating central drop foot in MS patients.},

  Abstract                 = {Ultrasound and electromyography (EMG) are two of the most commonly used diagnostic tools for the assessment of muscles. Recently, many studies reported the simultaneous collection of EMG signals and ultrasound images, which were normally amplified and digitized by different devices. However, there is lack of a systematic method to synchronize them and no study has reported the effects of ultrasound gel to the EMG signal collection during the simultaneous data collection. In this paper, we introduced a new method to synchronize ultrasound B-scan images, EMG signals, joint angles and other related signals (e.g. force and velocity signals) in real-time. The B-mode ultrasound images were simultaneously captured by the PC together with the surface EMG (SEMG) and the joint angle signal. The deformations of the forearm muscles induced by wrist motions were extracted from a sequence of ultrasound images, named as Sonomyography (SMG). Preliminary experiments demonstrated that the proposed method could reliably collect the synchronized ultrasound images, SEMG signals and joint angle signals in real-time. In addition, the effect of ultrasound gel on the SEMG signals when the EMG electrodes were close to the ultrasound probe was studied. It was found that the SEMG signals were not significantly affected by the amount of the ultrasound gel. The system is being used for the study of contractions of various muscles as well as the muscle fatigue.},

  Abstract                 = {Jensen MP, Kuehn CM, Amtmann D, Cardenas DD. Symptom burden in persons with spinal cord injury. 

OBJECTIVE
To determine (1) the frequency, severity, and reported course of 7 symptoms in persons with spinal cord injury (SCI) and (2) the association between these symptoms and patient functioning. 

DESIGN
Postal survey. 

SETTING
Community. 

INTERVENTION
A survey that included measures of the frequency, severity, and recalled course of pain, fatigue, numbness, weakness, shortness of breath, vision loss, and memory loss, as well as a measure of community integration and psychologic functioning was mailed to a sample of persons with SCI. One hundred forty-seven usable surveys were returned (response rate, 43{\%} of surveys mailed). 

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
The frequency and average severity of each symptom was computed, and the frequencies of each type of reported course were noted. Analyses estimated the associations among the symptoms, and between symptom severity and measures of patient functioning. 

RESULTS
The most common symptoms were pain, weakness, fatigue, and numbness. All symptoms were reported to remain the same or to get worse more often than they were reported to improve once they began. Pain, weakness, fatigue, and memory loss were the symptoms most closely associated with patient functioning. 

CONCLUSIONS
Patients with SCI must deal with a number of secondary complications in addition to any disability caused by the injury itself. Of 7 symptoms studied, pain, weakness, and fatigue appeared to be most common and most closely linked to patient social and mental health functioning. Research is needed to identify the causal relationships between perceived symptoms and quality of life in patients with SCI and to identify effective treatments for those symptoms shown to impact patient functioning.},

The closed-form solution to this programming problem then explicitly yields the equations that describe the time evolution of constrained linear and nonlinear mechanical systems. The direct approach used here does not require the use of any Lagrange multipliers, and the resulting equations are expressed in terms of two different classes of generalized inversesthe first class pertinent to the constraints, the second to the dynamics of the motion. These equa-tions can be numerically solved using any of the standard numerical techniques for solving differential equations. A closed-form analytical expression for the constraint forces required for a given mechanical system to satisfy a specific set of nonholonomic constraints is also provided.

  Abstract                 = {An Inertial Gait Phase Detection system was developed to replace heel switches and footswitches currently being used for the triggering of drop foot stimulators. A series of four algorithms utilising accelerometers and gyroscopes individually and in combination were tested and initial results are shown. Sensors were positioned on the outside of the upper shank. Tests were performed on data gathered from a subject, sufferer of stroke, implanted with a drop foot stimulator and triggered with the current trigger, the heel switch. Data tested includes a variety of activities representing everyday life. Flat surface walking, rough terrain and carpet walking show 100\% detection and the ability of the algorithms to ignore non-gait events such as weight shifts. Timing analysis is performed against the current triggering method, the heel switch. After evaluating the heel switch timing against a reference system, namely the Vicon 370 marker and force plates system. Initial results show a close correlation between the current trigger detection and the inertial sensor based triggering algorithms. Algorithms were tested for stairs up and stairs down. Best results are observed for algorithms using gyroscope data. Algorithms were designed using threshold techniques for lowest possible computational load and with least possible sensor components to minimize power requirements and to allow for potential future implantation of sensor system.},

  Abstract                 = {The new areas of technical exploitation of robotics systems has recently set new trends for the robotic actuation by demanding more versatile systems which can cope with unpredictable interactions within not well defined environments and work in close vicinity with the human. Following these trends, this work presents the development of a new actuation system with embodied characteristics such as passive compliance and variable physical damping. Compared to the other existing compliant linear or rotary actuators the proposed CompAct unit has the ability to regulate the oscillations induced by the introduction of the compliance by means of a variable physical damping actuator (VPDA) unit. Apart from facilitating the control the VPDA unit can assist in managing the energy transfer from/to the compliant module. The mechatronics, model and control scheme of the CompAct are analysed. The overall system is evaluated with experimental trials performed using a prototype unit. Preliminary results are presented to show that the unit and the proposed control scheme are capable of regulating the impedance components (stiffness and damping) within a wide range and with good fidelity.},

Bubbles respond to pressure forces and reveal their full potential when periodically driven by sound waves. The basic equations for nonlinear bubble oscillation in sound fields are given, together with a survey of typical solutions. A bubble in a liquid can be considered as a representative example from nonlinear dynamical systems theory with its resonances, multiple attractors with their basins, bifurcations to chaos and not yet fully describable behaviour due to infinite complexity. Three stability conditions are treated for stable trapping of bubbles in standing sound fields: positional, spherical and diffusional stability. Chemical reactions may become important in that respect, when reacting gases fill the bubble, but the chemistry of bubbles is just touched upon and is beyond the scope of the present report. Bubble collapse, the runaway shrinking of a bubble, is presented in its current state of knowledge. Pressures and temperatures that are reached at this occasion are discussed, as well as the light emission in the form of short flashes. Aspherical bubble collapse, as for instance enforced by boundaries nearby, mitigates most of the phenomena encountered in spherical collapse, but introduces a new effect: jet formation, the self-piercing of a bubble with a high velocity liquid jet. Examples of this phenomenon are given from light induced bubbles. Two oscillating bubbles attract or repel each other, depending on their oscillations and their distance. Upon approaching, attraction may change to repulsion and vice versa. When being close, they also shoot self-piercing jets at each other. Systems of bubbles are treated as they appear after shock wave passage through a liquid and with their branched filaments that they attain in standing sound fields. The N-bubble problem is formulated in the spirit of the n-body problem of astrophysics, but with more complicated interaction forces.

  Abstract                 = {This paper is concerned with the global exponential stability analysis problem for a general class of stochastic neural networks with mixed time-delays. The mixed time-delays under consideration comprise both the discrete time-varying delays and the distributed time-delays. The main purpose of this paper is to establish easily verifiable conditions under which the delayed stochastic neural network is exponentially stable in the mean square in the presence of both the discrete and distributed delays. By employing a new LyapunovâKrasovskii functional and conducting stochastic analysis, a linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach is developed to derive the criteria of the exponential stability. Furthermore, the main results are specialized to deal with the analysis problem for the global asymptotic stability within the same LMI framework. The proposed criteria can be readily checked by using some standard numerical packages such as the Matlab LMI toolbox. A simple example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed testing criteria.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper addresses the adaptive fuzzy tracking control problem for a class of uncertain nonlinear MIMO systems with the external disturbances. The adaptive fuzzy controllers are designed under the constraint that only system output is available for measurement. Then, it is needed to design a state observer to estimate the unmeasured states. In the observer design procedure, two prominent advantages are that it does not require the sign of the control gain coefficient to be known and only two parameters need to be adjusted on-line for each subsystem. By using Lyapunov analysis method, it is proven that all the signals in the closed-loop system are guaranteed to be bounded and the system outputs track the reference signals to a bounded compact set. The feasibility of the proposed approach is validated by using two simulation examples.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper examined if an electromyography (EMG) driven musculoskeletal model of the human knee could be used to predict knee moments, calculated using inverse dynamics, across a varied range of dynamic contractile conditions. Muscle-tendon lengths and moment arms of 13 muscles crossing the knee joint were determined from joint kinematics using a three-dimensional anatomical model of the lower limb. Muscle activation was determined using a second-order discrete non-linear model using rectified and low-pass filtered EMG as input. A modified Hill-type muscle model was used to calculate individual muscle forces using activation and muscle tendon lengths as inputs. The model was calibrated to six individuals by altering a set of physiologically based parameters using mathematical optimisation to match the net flexion/extension (FE) muscle moment with those measured by inverse dynamics. The model was calibrated for each subject using 5 different tasks, including passive and active FE in an isokinetic dynamometer, running, and cutting manoeuvres recorded using three-dimensional motion analysis. Once calibrated, the model was used to predict the FE moments, estimated via inverse dynamics, from over 200 isokinetic dynamometer, running and sidestepping tasks. The inverse dynamics joint moments were predicted with an average R 2 of 0.91 and mean residual error of B12 Nm. A re-calibration of only the EMG-to-activation parameters revealed FE moments prediction across weeks of similar accuracy. Changing the muscle model to one that is more physiologically correct produced better predictions. The modelling method presented represents a good way to estimate in vivo muscle forces during movement tasks.},

  Abstract                 = {Functional electrical stimulation (FES) can improve walking in individuals with mobility impairments. We evaluated accelerometers, force sensitive resistors, segment angles, and segment angular velocities to identify which sensor best determines the activation and deactivation times of the main muscles used during walking. This sensor(s) can be used in the future in conjunction with FES systems to improve walking. Able-bodied subjects walked at various speeds. Threshold levels were set for each sensor that minimized the difference between the times of activating and deactivating the electromyogram (EMG) of six muscles and the times of sensor threshold crossings as a percent of the step cycle. Mobility-impaired subjects walked at their preferred speed with and without FES to correct foot drop. Thresholds were set for these subjects so that sensor signals would cross at times that matched those of able-bodied subjects. Segment angles were generally the most effective sensor signals. Using segment angles of the thigh, shank, and foot, activation and deactivation times of the six muscles could be determined to within 6\% of the step cycle. The shank segment angle produced the lowest overall error and was among the top three sensors for 10 of the 12 events (activation and deactivation of six muscle groups). A segment angle sensor was implemented using a complementary filter (accelerometer/gyroscope combination). Using this sensor improved rule-based timing of FES in subjects with foot drop as compared to accelerometers alone.},

We obtained hip, knee, and ankle joints motions in the sagittal plane and electromyographic data from specific muscle groups.As the speed of gait increased, the length of stance phase progressively decreased from 62{\%} for walking to 31{\%} for running and to 22{\%} for sprinting. The sagittal plane motion increased as the speed of gait increased. Generally speaking, the body lowers its center of gravity with the increased speed by increasing flexion of the hips and knees and magnifying dorsiflexion at the ankle joint. Electromyographic activity about the knee demonstrated increased activity in the quadricep muscle group and hamstring group with increased speed. Mus cle function about the ankle joint demonstrated that the pos terior calf musculature which normally functions during the midstance phase in walking became a late swing phase muscle and was active through the f...},

  Abstract                 = {There is increasing interest in using robotic devices to assist in movement training following neurologic injuries such as stroke and spinal cord injury. This paper reviews control strategies for robotic therapy devices. Several categories of strategies have been proposed, including, assistive, challenge-based, haptic simulation, and coaching. The greatest amount of work has been done on developing assistive strategies, and thus the majority of this review summarizes techniques for implementing assistive strategies, including impedance-, counterbalance-, and EMG- based controllers, as well as adaptive controllers that modify control parameters based on ongoing participant performance. Clinical evidence regarding the relative effectiveness of different types of robotic therapy controllers is limited, but there is initial evidence that some control strategies are more effective than others. It is also now apparent there may be mechanisms by which some robotic control approaches might actually decrease the recovery possible with comparable, non-robotic forms of training. In future research, there is a need for head-to-head comparison of control algorithms in randomized, controlled clinical trials, and for improved models of human motor recovery to provide a more rational framework for designing robotic therapy control strategies.},

  Abstract                 = {Mathematical models have been developed to predict fatigue during functional electrical stimulation, but the predictive accuracy at different muscle lengths is unknown. The objectives of our study were to: (1) experimentally determine the relationship between knee extension angle (20 degrees, 40 degrees, 65 degrees, and 90 degrees) and fatigue of the quadriceps muscles, and (2) predict that relationship using a mathematical model. A computer-controlled stimulator sent trains of pulses to surface electrodes on the thighs of five subjects while forces were measured at the ankle. A two-component mathematical model was developed. One component accounted for force, and the other accounted for fatigue. The model was fit to the data, and parameters were identified at 90 degrees . The fitted subject-averaged r(2) value was 0.89. The model was used to predict fatigue at the remaining angles, and the subject-averaged r(2) values were {\textgreater}0.75. Therefore, at least 75{\%} of the variability in the measurements was explained by the model. The force model is explicitly dependent on angle, and the fatigue model is explicitly dependent on force; therefore, the dependence of fatigue on knee angle was implicit.},

  Abstract                 = {A general-purpose system to obtain the kinematics of gait in the sagittal plane based on body-mounted sensors was developed. It consisted of four uniaxial seismic accelerometers and one rate gyroscope per body segment. Tests were done with 10 young healthy volunteers, walking at five different speeds on a treadmill. In order to study the system's accuracy, measurements were made with an optic, passive-marker system and the body-mounted system, simultaneously. In all the comparison cases, the curves obtained from the two systems were very close, showing root mean square errors representing <7\% full range in 75\% of the cases (overall mean 6.64\%, standard deviation 4.13\%) and high coefficients of multiple correlation in 100\% of cases (overall mean 0.9812, standard deviation 0.02). Calibration of the body-mounted system is done against gravity. The body-mounted sensors do not hinder natural movement. The calculation algorithms are computationally demanding and only are applicable off-line. The body-mounted sensors are accurate, inexpensive and portable and allow long-term recordings in clinical, sport and ergonomics settings.},

  Abstract                 = {This article presents a stimulation control method using a uniaxial gyroscope measuring angular velocity of the shank in the sagittal plane, to control functional electrical stimulation of the triceps surae to improve push-off of stroke subjects during gait. The algorithm is triggered during each swing phase of gait when the angular velocity of the shank is relatively high. Subsequently, the start of the stance phase is detected by a change of sign of the gyroscope signal at approximately the same time as heel strike. Stimulation is triggered when the shank angle reaches a preset value since the beginning of stance. The change of angle is determined by integrating angular velocity from the moment of change of sign. The results show that the real-time reliability of stimulation control was at least 95\% for four of the five stroke subjects tested, two of which were 100\% reliable. For the remaining subject, the reliability was increased from 50\% found during the experiment, to 99\% during offline processing. Our conclusion is that a uniaxial gyroscope on the shank is a simple, more reliable alternative to the heel switch for the purpose of restoring push-off of stroke subjects during gait.},

Both the intramuscular MU spikes and surface EMG were recorded simultaneously and analyzed by means of a computer-aided intramuscular spike amplitude-frequency histogram and frequency power spectral analysis, respectively. Results indicated that both mean power frequency (MPF) and amplitude (rmsEMG) of the surface EMG fell significantly (P less than 0.001) together with a progressive reduction in MU spike amplitude and firing frequency during sustained MVC. During 50{\%} MVC there was a significant decline in MPF (P less than 0.001), but this decline was accompanied by a significant increase in rmsEMG (P less than 0.001) and a progressive MU recruitment as evidenced by an increased number of MUs with relatively large spike amplitude. Our data suggest that the surface EMG amplitude could better represent the underlying MU activity during muscle fatigue and the frequency powers spectral shift may or may not reflect changes in MU recruitment and rate-coding patterns.},

  Abstract                 = {The conventional robotic assistive device was based on pre-programmed functions by the robot expert. This makes it difficult for stroke patients use it effectively due to difficulty of torque setting that is suitable for the user movement. Electromyography (EMG) signal measures the electrical signal of muscle contraction. The EMG-based robotics assistive technology would enable the stroke patients to control the robot movement according to the user's own strength of natural movement. This paper discusses the mapping of surface electromyography signals (sEMG) to torque for robotic rehabilitation. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) has been applied as a control algorithm for a number of selected mathematical models. sEMG signals were determined as input data to the mathematical model where parameters of the mathematical model were optimized using PSO. Hence, the good correlated estimated torque as output was obtained.},

  Abstract                 = {EMG-driven models can be used to estimate muscle force in biomechanical systems. Collected and processed EMG readings are used as the input of a dynamic system, which is integrated numerically. This approach requires the definition of a reasonably large set of parameters. Some of these vary widely among subjects, and slight inaccuracies in such parameters can lead to large model output errors. One of these parameters is the maximum voluntary contraction force (Fom). This paper proposes an approach to find Fom by estimating muscle physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) using ultrasound (US), which is multiplied by a realistic value of maximum muscle specific tension. Ultrasound is used to measure muscle thickness, which allows for the determination of muscle volume through regression equations. Soleus, gastrocnemius medialis and gastrocnemius lateralis PCSAs are estimated using published volume proportions among leg muscles, which also requires measurements of muscle fiber length and pennation angle by US. Fom obtained by this approach and from data widely cited in the literature was used to comparatively test a Hill-type EMG-driven model of the ankle joint. The model uses 3 EMGs (Soleus, gastrocnemius medialis and gastrocnemius lateralis) as inputs with joint torque as the output. The EMG signals were obtained in a series of experiments carried out with 8 adult male subjects, who performed an isometric contraction protocol consisting of 10s step contractions at 20{\%} and 60{\%} of the maximum voluntary contraction level. Isometric torque was simultaneously collected using a dynamometer.

In 20 healthy participants (10 males, 10 females), CSA, MT and EI were measured from panoramic US scans of the hamstrings on 2 separate days. The intra-class correlation coefficients and standard errors of measurement as a percentage of the mean for CSA, MT and EI ranged from 0.715 to 0.984 and from 3.145 to 12.541{\%} in the males and from 0.724 to 0.977 and from 4.571 to 17.890{\%} in the females, respectively. The males had greater CSAs and MTs and lower EIs than the females (pÂ =Â 0.002â0.049), and significant relationships were observed between CSA and MT (rÂ =Â 0.714-0.938, pÂ ?Â 0.001â0.023). From an overall reliability standpoint, these findings suggest that panoramic US may be a reliable technique for examining muscle size and quality of the hamstrings in both males and females.},

  Abstract                 = {A new highly reliable gait phase detection system, which can be used in gait analysis applications and to control the gait cycle of a neuroprosthesis for walking, is described. The system was designed to detect in real-time the following gait phases: stance, heel-off, swing, and heel-strike. The gait phase detection system employed a gyroscope to measure the angular velocity of the foot and three force sensitive resistors to assess the forces exerted by the foot on the shoe sole during walking. A rule-based detection algorithm, which was running on a portable microprocessor board, processed the sensor signals. In the presented experimental study ten able body subjects and six subjects with impaired gait tested the device in both indoor and outdoor environments (0-25 degrees C). The subjects were asked to walk on flat and irregular surfaces, to step over small obstacles, to walk on inclined surfaces, and to ascend and descend stairs. Despite the significant variation in the individual walking styles the system achieved an overall detection reliability above 99\% for both subject groups for the tasks involving walking on flat, irregular, and inclined surfaces. In the case of stair climbing and descending tasks the success rate of the system was above 99\% for the able body subjects and above 96 \% for the subjects with impaired gait. The experiments also showed that the gait phase detection system, unlike other similar devices, was insensitive to perturbations caused by nonwalking activities such as weight shifting between legs during standing, feet sliding, sitting down, and standing up.},

The micro-robot, which is composed of neodymiumironboron with dimensions 250 1m 1 130 1m 1 10 1m, is actuated by a system of six macro-scale electromagnets. Periodically varying magnetic fields are used to impose magnetic torques, which induce stickslip motion in the micro-robot. These magnetic forces and torques are incorporated into a comprehensive dynamic model, which captures the behavior of the micro-robot. By pivoting the micro-robot about an edge, non-planar obstacles with characteristic sizes comparable to the robot length can be surmounted. Actuation is demonstrated on several substrates with different surface properties, in a fluid environment, and in a vacuum. Observed micro-robot translation speeds can exceed 10 mm s 21 .},

Muscle activity was elicited in 11 normal subjects by performing six manual muscle tests. Three of the tests followed the standard technique and three were modifications designed to provide better differentiation of muscle action. All electromyographic data were quantified by computer integration and normalized to cancel out sampling inconsistency. None of the muscle tests totally restricted activity to the designated muscle, but the tests did determine which was the strongest participant. During the standard specific gastrocnemius and soleus muscle tests, the corresponding surface electrode provided a lower electromyogram than did the matching wire electrode; that is, the surface-to-wire-electrode ratio was less than one (gastrocnemius = 0.74, soleus = 0.58). This ratio was greater than one when the electromyogram was being recorded from one muscle while testing another muscle (gastrocnemius = 1.55, soleus = 1.92). The mathematical model relating surface-electrode values to the wire-electrode data from all three muscles identified 60 percent of the surface gastrocnemius electrode electromyogram as arising from that muscle, while only 36 percent of the soleus surface electrode data related to the activity of the soleus: Sg = .19Ws + 60Wg + .13Wt + .08Wo and Ss = .36Ws + .31Wg + .22Wt + .11Wo.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Direct electrical activation of skeletal muscles of patients with upper motor neuron lesions can restore functional movements, such as standing or walking. Because responses to electrical stimulation are highly nonlinear and time varying, accurate control of muscles to produce functional movements is very difficult. Accurate and predictive mathematical models can facilitate the design of stimulation patterns and control strategies that will produce the desired force and motion. In the present study, we build upon our previous isometric model to capture the effects of constant angular velocity on the forces produced during electrically elicited concentric contractions of healthy human quadriceps femoris muscle. Modelling the isovelocity condition is important because it will enable us to understand how our model behaves under the relatively simple condition of constant velocity and will enable us to better understand the interactions of muscle length, limb velocity, and stimulation pattern on the force produced by the muscle. METHODS: An additional term was introduced into our previous isometric model to predict the force responses during constant velocity limb motion. Ten healthy subjects were recruited for the study. Using a KinCom dynamometer, isometric and isovelocity force data were collected from the human quadriceps femoris muscle in response to a wide range of stimulation frequencies and patterns. {\%} error, linear regression trend lines, and paired t-tests were used to test how well the model predicted the experimental forces. In addition, sensitivity analysis was performed using Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test to obtain a measure of the sensitivity of our model's output to changes in model parameters. RESULTS: Percentage RMS errors between modelled and experimental forces determined for each subject at each stimulation pattern and velocity showed that the errors were in general less than 20{\%}. The coefficients of determination between the measured and predicted forces show that the model accounted for approximately 86{\%} and approximately 85{\%} of the variances in the measured force-time integrals and peak forces, respectively. CONCLUSION: The range of predictive abilities of the isovelocity model in response to changes in muscle length, velocity, and stimulation frequency for each individual make it ideal for dynamic applications like FES cycling.},

An accurate and predictive mathematical model can facilitate the design of stimulation patterns that produce the desired force. The present study is a first step in developing a mathematical model for non-isometric muscle contractions. The goals of this study were to: (1) identify how our isometric force model's parameters vary with changes in knee joint angle, (2) identify the best knee flexion angle to parameterize this model, and (3) validate the model by comparing experimental data to predictions in response to a wide range of stimulation frequencies and muscle lengths. Results showed that by parabolically varying one of the free parameters with knee joint angle and fixing the other parameters at the values identified at 40 degrees of knee flexion, the model could predict the force responses to a wide range of stimulation frequencies and patterns at different muscle lengths. This work showed that the current isometric force model is capable of predicting the changes in skeletal muscle force at different muscle lengths.},

  Abstract                 = {Superimposition of electrical stimulation during voluntary contractions is used to produce functional movements in individuals with central nervous system impairment, to evaluate the ability to activate a muscle, to characterize the nature of fatigue, and to improve muscle strength during postsurgical rehabilitation. Currently, the manner in which voluntary contractions and electrically elicited forces summate is not well understood. The objective of the present study is to develop a model that predicts the forces obtained when electrical stimulation is superimposed on a volitional contraction. Quadriceps femoris muscles of 12 able-bodied subjects were tested. Our results showed that the total force produced when electrical stimulation was superimposed during a volitional contraction could be modeled by the equation T=V+S[(MaxForce-V)/MaxForce]N, where T is the total force produced, V is the force in response to volitional contraction alone, S is the force response to the electrical stimulation alone, MaxForce is the maximum force-generating ability of the muscle, and N is a parameter that we posit depends on the differences in the motor unit recruitment order and firing rates between volitional and electrically elicited contractions. In addition, our results showed that the model predicted accurately (intraclass correlation coefficient{\textgreater}or=0.97) the total force in response to a wide range of stimulation intensities and frequencies superimposed on a wide range of volitional contraction levels. Thus the model will be helpful to clinicians and scientists to predict the amount of stimulation needed to produce the targeted force levels in individuals with partial paralysis.},

  Abstract                 = {Exoskeletons that enhance human strength, endurance, and speed while being transparent to the wearer are feasible. In order to be transparent, the exoskeleton must determine the user's intent, apply forces when and where appropriate, and present low impedance to the wearer. We present a one degree of freedom exoskeleton called the RoboKnee which achieves a high level of transparency. User intent is determined through the knee joint angle and ground reaction forces. Torque is applied across the knee in order to allow the user's quadriceps muscles to relax. Low impedance is achieved through the use of series elastic actuators. The RoboKnee allows the wearer to climb stairs and perform deep knee bends while carrying a significant load in a backpack. The device provides most of the energy required to work against gravity while the user stays in control, deciding when and where to walk, as well as providing balance and control. Videos, photographs, and more information about the RoboKnee can be found at http://www.yobotics.com.},

  Abstract                 = {Series elastic actuators have a spring intentionally placed at the actuator output. Measuring the spring strain gives an accurate measurement for closed-loop actuator force control. The low spring stiffness allows for high gain while maintaining actuator stability. This gives series elastic actuators many desirable properties including high bandwidth at moderate force amplitudes, low output impedance, large dynamic range, internal error rejection and tolerance to shock loading. However, as a consequence of the elasticity, the large force bandwidth capabilities of the actuator are reduced when operating at power saturation limits. Series elasticity is examined with three models. First, it is generalized by using a minimal actuator model. This mathematical model consists of an ideal velocity source actuator, linear spring and proportional controller. Series elasticity is then demonstrated in two cases of physical actuator systems. The first is a linear hydraulic piston with a servo valve and the second is an electric motor with a geared linear transmission. Both case studies have a linear spring and low complexity control systems. The case studies are analyzed mathematically and verified with physical hardware. A series elastic actuator under simple closed-loop control is physically equivalent to a second order system. This means that an equivalent mass defined by the control system and physical parameters, is effectively in series with the physical spring connected to the actuator load. Nondimensional analysis of the dynamics clarifies important parametric relationships into a few key dimensionless groups and aids understanding when trying to scale the actuators. The physical equivalent abstractions and non-dimensional dynamic equations help in the development of guidelines for choosing a proper spring stiffness given required force, speed and power requirements for the actuator.},

In these systems, a plant with linear dynamics is controlled by a linear controller which is located in the feedback loop between a sensing block and a zero-order-hold. The sensing block comprises several sensors with asynchronous uncertain non-uniform sampling intervals. We present sufficient Krasovskii-based stability and stabilization criteria as a set of linear matrix inequalities. It is shown through examples that choosing the right sensors with adequate sampling frequencies has a considerable impact on controller design and stability of the closed-loop system.},

  Abstract                 = {Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is a promising technique to artificially activate muscles as a means to potentially restore the capability to perform functional tasks in persons with neurological disorders. A pervasive problem with NMES is that overstimulation of the muscle (among other factors) leads to rapid muscle fatigue, which limits the use of clinical and commercial NMES systems. The objective of this paper is to develop an NMES controller that incorporates the effects of muscle fatigue during NMES-induced non-isometric contraction of the human quadriceps femoris muscle. Our previous work that used the RISE class of nonlinear controllers cannot accommodate fatigue and muscle activation dynamics. A totally new control design approach and associated stability proof is required to derive a new class of NMES control design that accounts for muscle fatigue dynamics and a first order activation dynamics, in addition to the second order musculoskeletal dynamics. Motivated from a control method for robotic systems in a strict-feedback form, a backstepping based nonlinear NMES controller was designed to accommodate for the additional muscle activation dynamics. Further, experimentally identified estimates of the fatigue and activation dynamics were incorporated in the control design. The developed controller uses a neural network-based estimate of the musculoskeletal dynamics and error due to fatigue estimation. A globally uniformly ultimately bounded stability is proven the new controller that accounts for an uncertain nonlinear muscle model and bounded nonlinear disturbances (e.g., spasticity, changing load dynamics). The developed controller was validated through experiments on the left and right legs of 3 able-bodied subjects and was compared with a proportional-derivative (PD) controller and a PD augmented with a neural network. The statistical analysis showed improved control performance compared to the PD controller.},

Sufficient conditions are presented to ensure global exponential stability of the observation errors by constructing a LyapunovâKrasovskii function. A numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

  Abstract                 = {The aim of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of using the continuous signals about the thickness and pennation angle changes of muscles detected in real-time from ultrasound images, named as sonomyography (SMG), to characterize muscles under isometric contraction, along with synchronized surface electromyography (EMG) and generated torque signals. The right biceps brachii muscles of seven normal young adult subjects were tested. We observed that exponential functions could well represent the relationships between the normalized EMG root-mean-square (RMS) and the torque, the RMS and the muscle deformation SMG, and the RMS and the pennation angle SMG for the data of the contraction phase, with exponent coefficients of 0.0341 +/- 0.0148 (Mean SD), 0.0619 +/- 0.0273, and 0.0266 +/- 0.0076, respectively. In addition, the preliminary results also demonstrated linear relationships between the normalized torque and the muscle deformation as well as the pennation angle with the ratios of 9 .79 +/- 3.01 and 2.02 +/- 0.53, respectively. The overall mean R2 for the regressions was approximately 0.9 and the overall mean relative root mean square error (RRMSE) smaller than 15{\%}. The potential values of SMG together with EMG to provide a more comprehensive assessment for the muscle functions should be further investigated with more subjects and more muscle groups.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Stimulators applying functional electrical stimulation (FES) to the common peroneal nerve improve walking with a foot drop, which occurs in several disorders. OBJECTIVE: To compare the orthotic and therapeutic effects of a foot drop stimulator on walking performance of subjects with chronic nonprogressive (eg, stroke) and progressive (eg, multiple sclerosis) disorders. METHODS: Subjects with nonprogressive (41) and progressive (32) conditions used a foot drop stimulator for 3 to 12 months while walking in the community. Walking speed was measured with a 10-m test and a 4-minute figure-8 test; physiological cost index (PCI) and device usage were also measured. The subjects were tested with FES on and off (orthotic effect) before and after (therapeutic effect) stimulator use. RESULTS: After 3 months of FES use, the nonprogressive and progressive groups had a similar, significant orthotic effect (5.0\% and 5.7\%, respectively, P < .003; percentage change in mean values) and therapeutic effect with FES off (17.8\% and 9.1\%, respectively, P < .005) on figure-8 walking speed. Overall, PCI showed a decreasing trend (P = .031). The therapeutic effect on figure-8 speed diverged later between both groups to 28.0\% (P < .001) and 7.9\% at 11 months. The combined therapeutic plus orthotic effect on figure-8 speed at 11 months was, respectively, 37.8\% (P < .001) and 13.1\% (P = .012); PCI decreased 18.2\% (P = .038) and 6.5\%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Subjects with progressive and nonprogressive disorders had an orthotic benefit from FES up to 11 months. The therapeutic effect increased for 11 months in nonprogressive disorders but only for 3 months in progressive disorders. The combined effect remained significant and clinically relevant.},

  Abstract                 = {Within the context of impedance controlled exoskeletons, common actuators have important drawbacks. Either the actuators are heavy, have a complex structure or are poor torque sources, due to gearing or heavy nonlinearity. Considering our application, an impedance controlled gait rehabilitation robot for treadmill-training, we designed an actuation system that might avoid these drawbacks. It combines a lightweight joint and a simple structure with adequate torque source quality. It consists of a servomotor, a flexible Bowden cable transmission, and a force feedback loop based on a series elastic element. A basic model was developed that is shown to describe the basic dynamics of the actuator well enough for design purpose.Further measurements show that performance is sufficient for use in a gait rehabilitation robot. The demanded force tracking bandwidths were met: 11 Hz bandwidth for the full force range (demanded 4 Hz) and 20 Hz bandwidth for smaller force range (demanded 12 Hz). The mechanical output i...},

  Abstract                 = {Gait initiation in transfemoral amputees (TFA) is different from non-amputees. This is mainly caused by the lack of stability and push-off from the prosthetic leg. Adding control and artificial push-off to the prosthesis may therefore be beneficial to TFA. In this study the feasibility of real-time intention detection of gait initiation was determined by mimicking the TFA situation in non-amputees. EMG and inertial sensor data was measured in 10 non-amputees. Only data available in TFA was used to determine if gait initiation can be predicted in time to control a transfemoral prosthesis to generate push-off and stability. Toe-off and heel-strike of the leading limb are important parameters to be detected, to control a prosthesis and to time push-off. The results show that toe-off and heel-strike of the leading limb can be detected using EMG and kinematic data in non-amputees 130â260ms in advance. This leaves enough time to control a prosthesis. Based on these results we hypothesize that similar results can be found in TFA, allowing for adequate control of a prosthesis during gait initiation.},

  Abstract                 = {In this study we determined if detection of the onset of gait initiation in transfemoral amputees can be useful for voluntary control of upper leg prostheses. From six transfemoral amputees inertial sensor data and EMG were measured at the prosthetic leg during gait initiation. First, initial movement was detected from the inertial sensor data. Subsequently it was determined whether EMG could predict initial movement before detection based on the inertial sensors with comparable consistency as the inertial sensors. From the inertial sensors the initial movement can be determined. If the prosthetic leg leads, the upper leg accelerometer data was able to detect initial movement best. If the intact leg leads the upper leg gyroscope data performed best. Inertial sensors at the upper leg in general showed detections at the same time or earlier than those at the lower leg. EMG can predict initial movement up to a 138ms in advance, when the prosthetic leg leads. One subject showed consistent EMG onset up to 248ms before initial movement in the intact leg leading condition. A new method to detect initial movement from inertial sensors was presented and can be useful for additional prosthetic control. EMG measured at the prosthetic leg can be used for prediction of gait initiation when the prosthetic leg is leading, but for the intact leg leading condition this will not be of additional value.},

  Abstract                 = {There is a growing trend in the physical therapy profession to use conventional grayscale brightness (B-mode) ultrasound imaging (USI) as a tool to assess the morphological (form and structure) and morphometric (measures of form) characteristics of muscle, and to use these findings to draw conclusions regarding muscle function. This trend is reflected in numerous published investigations. As many physical therapists may lack training in the principles and instrumentation underlying USI use, it is critical that therapists gain a clear understanding of the information that USI can, and cannot, provide about muscle function before employing the technique for either research or clinical applications. Failure to do so may result in the propagation of inaccurate terminology and beliefs. This paper aims to clarify the role that USI has in the assessment of muscle function, first, by briefly reviewing how conventional grayscale B-mode ultrasound images and clips are generated, and second, by summarizing the types of information that these images can provide. It also discusses the various factors that need to be considered when interpreting a dynamic USI assessment of muscle specifically as it relates to the assessment of muscle function.},

  Abstract                 = {The goal of this article is to review the state-of-the-art tracking methods, classify them into different categories, and identify new trends. Object tracking, in general, is a challenging problem. Difficulties in tracking objects can arise due to abrupt object motion, changing appearance patterns of both the object and the scene, nonrigid object structures, object-to-object and object-to-scene occlusions, and camera motion. Tracking is usually performed in the context of higher-level applications that require the location and/or shape of the object in every frame. Typically, assumptions are made to constrain the tracking problem in the context of a particular application. In this survey, we categorize the tracking methods on the basis of the object and motion representations used, provide detailed descriptions of representative methods in each category, and examine their pros and cons. Moreover, we discuss the important issues related to tracking including the use of appropriate image features, selection of motion models, and detection of objects.},

  Abstract                 = {Inspired by the natural design of bacterial flagella, we report artificial bacterial flagella (ABF) that have a comparable shape and size to their organic counterparts and can swim in a controllable fashion using weak applied magnetic fields. The helical swimmer consists of a helical tail resembling the dimensions of a natural flagellum and a thin soft-magnetic head on one end. The swimming locomotion of ABF is precisely controlled by three orthogonal electromagnetic coil pairs. Microsphere manipulation is performed, and the thrust force generated by an ABF is analyzed. ABF swimmers represent the first demonstration of microscopic artificial swimmers that use helical propulsion. Self-propelled devices such as these are of interest in fundamental research and for biomedical applications.},

  Abstract                 = {Electromyography (EMG) has been widely used for the assessment of musculoskeletal functions and the control of electrical prostheses, which make use of the EMG signal generated by the contraction of the residual muscles. In spite of the successful applications of EMG in different fields, it has some inherent limitations, such as the difficulty to differentiate the actions of neighboring muscles and to collect signals from deep muscles using the surface EMG. The majority of current EMG controlled prostheses can only provide sequential onâoff controls using signals from two groups of muscles, so the users are required to put many conscious efforts in monitoring the speed and range of motion of the terminal devices being controlled. Recently, many alternative signals based on the detection of dimensional changes of muscles or tendons during actions have been reported. The objective of this study was to investigate the potential of the dimensional change of muscles detected using sonography for musculoskeletal assessment and control. A portable B-mode ultrasound scanner was used to collect the dynamic ultrasound images of the forearm muscles of six normally limbed young adults and three amputee subjects. A motion analysis system was used to collect the movement of the wrist angle during the experiments for the normal subjects. It was demonstrated that the morphological changes of forearm muscles during actions can be successfully detected by ultrasound and linearly correlated (R2=0.876Â±0.042, meanÂ±S.D.) with the wrist angle. We named these sonographically detected signals about the architectural change of the muscle as sonomyography (SMG). The mean ratio between the wrist angle and the percentage deformation of the forearm muscle was 7.2Â±3.7Â°/{\%} for the normal subjects. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of this ratio among the three repeated tests was 0.868. The SMG signals from the residual forearms were also successfully detected when the three amputee subjects contracted their residual muscles. The results demonstrated that SMG had potentials for the musculoskeletal control and assessment.},

  Abstract                 = {Ultrasound imaging has been used frequently for the study of muscle contraction, including measurements of pennation angles and fascicle orientations. However, these measurements were traditionally conducted by manually drawing lines on the ultrasound images. In this study, we proposed a modified Hough transform (HT), aiming at automatically estimating orientations of straight line-shaped patterns, such as muscle fibers and muscle-bone interface in ultrasound images. The new method first located the global maximum in the HT accumulator matrix, which corresponded to the most dominant collinear feature points globally, using the standard HT; then the pixels close to the detected line were removed from the edge map, the HT accumulator matrix was calculated again, i.e., revoting, and a new line was detected. The iteration was repeated until the predefined termination conditions were satisfied. The performance of the algorithm was tested using computer-generated images with different levels of noises, as well as clinical ultrasound images, and compared with that of the conventional method. It was found that the orientation estimation results obtained by the new algorithm were well correlated (R2= 0.965), with those obtained using the traditional method, i.e., drawing lines manually and reading the angles with the assistance of software. Further mean-difference plots revealed a difference of 0.18 Â± 2.41Â° between the two methods at the 95{\%} confidence level. Compared with the traditional method, the new algorithm was more capable of handling with highly noisy data and could avoid the aliasing problem, i.e., reporting multiple lines instead of single expected line. The results of this study suggested that the proposed revoting HT can be potentially used for the reliable and nonsubjective automatic estimation of the orientations of muscle fibers in musculoskeletal ultrasound images.
